> [[Rust]] is a _==statically typed==_ language.
> Means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.
> The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many types are possible, such as when we converted a [[String]] to a numeric type using [[parse]]
