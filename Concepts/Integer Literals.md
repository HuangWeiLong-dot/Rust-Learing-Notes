You can write integer literals in any of the forms

|Number literals|Example|
|---|---|
|Decimal|`98_222`|
|Hex|`0xff`|
|Octal|`0o77`|
|Binary|`0b1111_0000`|
|Byte (`u8` only)|`b'A'`

> [!tip]
> Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.
